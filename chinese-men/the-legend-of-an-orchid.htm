    <p>Yan Ji was a humble concubine of Zheng Wen-Gong who was a monarch of Zheng State in the Spring-Autumn Period. Though she was a daughter of the monarch of the southern Yan State, Zheng Wen-Gong seldom met her. In a night, she dreamed that a herald of Heaven gave her an orchid and said, “I am Boshu. I, your ancestor, let it be your son. Because an orchid is fragrant as national virtues, people will love your son as they love orchids. ” In the following day, Wen-Gong came to meet her, and gave an orchid to her. Next morning, when Wen-Gong was ready to leave, Yan Ji said to him, “I am humble, and I am honored that I will bear a son for you in the future. Can we regard this orchid as a pledge?” Wen-Gong gladly said, “All right.” After ten months, Yan Ji bore a son. Wen-Gong named the baby “Lan” which meant orchid.</p>
